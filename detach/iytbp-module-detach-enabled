This is a flag file for the iYTBP detach script.

Description:

Use following files by putting them into /data/ to take effect

File "iytbp-module-detach-disabled"
Use this if u want to detach YT app from playstore on every boot (like the magisk installer does by default)

File "iytbp-module-detach-enabled"
Use this if u want to attach previosly detached YT app to playstore again. This file has priority over the detach flag file above and gets
deleted after first execution of the attach function (because it's just needed to execute once and not needed on every boot)

If both of the flag files are deleted from /data/ the boot script is disabled and no detach or attach function will be executed at bootime.
