# YouTube Vanced - Magisk Repo

This is the official magisk repo version of the Youtube Vanced project, more info in the [official thread on XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-youtube-vanced-edition-t3758757)
The version in this repo **ONLY supports arm/arm64/x86/x86_64 devices and minAPI21 systems**. There is also a [black themed variant](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/iYTBP-Vanced-Magisk-Repo) of this version available.

### NOTE:
**Due to theme modification changes since Youtube Vanced build 01.17.10 (theme is in-app switchable now!) white and dark stock themed variants are combined in one version and are provided in this repo.
White stock theme is used by default if u start the app the first time. If u want to use the dark stock theme u can switch to it via Vanced "Layout Settings". The black mod themed variant of
this module will have the black theme instead the dark stock theme included**

**This repo gets always updated `AFTER` the official Apk variants are available/released so expect up-to-date delays**
